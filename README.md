# 3D Car Platformer Prototype

## Project Overview

Developed in **Unity 6**, this prototype explores a hybrid genre that merges **vehicle simulation** with **classic 3D platforming**. The core concept challenges players to master precise car handling—covering acceleration, drifting, and aerial control—within intricate, vertical environments.

This build demonstrates the **foundational vehicle physics** and **control systems** within a functional greybox level designed for rapid testing and iteration.

## Core Gameplay Loop & Mechanics

The gameplay loop is centered on **time-trial platforming**, where players must navigate complex obstacle courses to reach a goal.

* Precision driving and momentum management are key.
* A dedicated **jump mechanic** transforms the car into a platforming agent, enabling players to clear large gaps and tackle vertical challenges.
* Future iterations will introduce **AI enemies** to act as dynamic hazards and expand the challenge.

## Vehicle Physics & Engine Simulation

The vehicle controller is designed to **balance realism with arcade fun**.

* **Engine Model**: Implements an RPM-to-torque curve for authentic power delivery.
* **Wheel & Steering System**: Physically-based and dynamically responsive to forces.
* **Advanced Maneuvers**: Supports drifting, controlled jumps, and momentum-driven movement.

This system serves as the technical foundation for expanding into larger levels and more complex gameplay challenges.

## Current State

* Functional greybox test level.
* Fully implemented vehicle controller with arcade-inspired yet realistic physics.
* Prototype stage with focus on **movement mechanics**.

---

## Future Plans

* Add enemy AI hazards to expand gameplay.
* Create polished levels with full platforming challenges.
* Implement visual and audio feedback to enhance player immersion.
